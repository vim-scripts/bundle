*bundle* is a Vim plugin to easily load a series of files which is called as
"bundle".  For example, if you often edit files foo.c, bar.txt and baz.vim in
project named "qux", you can use "|:LoadBundle| qux" to load the files.

The correspondence of bundle names and lists of files can be configured by
static way (|g:bundle_dictionary|) and dynamic way (|bundle-events|).
